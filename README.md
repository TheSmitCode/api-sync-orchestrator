# api-sync-orchestrator
A lightweight, JSON-configurable Python tool for orchestrating API data syncs—pull from multiple sources (e.g., Stripe, Shopify), transform with simple rules, and push to targets like Airtable or Postgres. Perfect for ETL without the bloat: CLI for devs, web API for non-techies. Inspired by real-world Upwork gigs for e-comm/CRM integrations.
